# Applied Statistics

## Overview of Repository
This repository contains my work for the Applied Statistics module. It includes all the files necessary to fit the brief provided by the lecturer. The project files are project.ipynb and tasks.ipynb.

## Files in Repository

### Project.ipynb
The project investigates differences in plant weights across three groups (ctrl, trt1, and trt2) using  t-tests and one-way ANOVA testing.

### Tasks.ipynb
This file handles four specific tasks, each focusing on different methods of statistical analysis.

### README.md
This document provides an outline of the repository and lists all references used.

### Images Folder
Contains images used within the assignments.

### Data Folder
Contains the dataset PlantGrowth used in the project.

### requirements.txt
Lists all the packages needed to run the notebooks.

## Project Details
The project uses the PlantGrowth R dataset to analyze plant weights across three groups.The notebook contains explanations and code comments for each step.

### Libraries Needed
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
